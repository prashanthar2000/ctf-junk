    , PhaseOptions usage:

    go tool compile -d=ssa/<phase>/<flag>[=<value>|<function_name>]

where:

- <phase> is one of:


- <flag> is one of:
    on, off, debug, mem, time, test, stats, dump

- <value> defaults to 1

- <function_name> is required for the "dump" flag, and specifies the
  name of function to dump after <phase>

Phase "all" supports flags "time", "mem", and "dump".
Phase "intrinsics" supports flags "on", "off", and "debug".

If the "dump" flag is specified, the output is written on a file named
<phase>__<function_name>_<seq>.dump; otherwise it is directed to stdout.

Examples:

    -d=ssa/check/on
enables checking after each phase

    -d=ssa/all/time
enables time reporting for all phases

    -d=ssa/prove/debug=2
sets debugging level to 2 in the prove pass

Multiple flags can be passed at once, by separating them with
commas. For example:

    -d=ssa/check/on,ssa/all/time
