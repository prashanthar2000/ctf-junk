  Returns true when called within ion. When ion is disabled or when compilation is abnormally
  slow to start, this function returns an error string. Otherwise, this function returns false.
  This behaviour ensures that a falsy value means that we are not in ion, but expect a
  compilation to occur in the future. Conversely, a truthy value means that we are either in
  ion or that there is litle or no chance of ion ever compiling the current script.
