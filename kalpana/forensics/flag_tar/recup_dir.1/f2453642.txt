ggregate step takes an aggregated snapshot of the CodeHeap.
   Subsequent print functions create their output based on this snapshot.
   The CodeHeap is a living thing, and every effort has been made for the
   collected data to be consistent. Only the method names and signatures
   are retrieved at print time. That may lead to rare cases where the
   name of a method is no longer available, e.g. because it was unloaded.
