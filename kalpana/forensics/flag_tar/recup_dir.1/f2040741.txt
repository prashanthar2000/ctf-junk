 set to any value other than '' or '0'/'N'/'n', starts the
  profiler immediately on start-up.
  Useful if you want profile code that runs very early.

  MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP_ENTRIES=<1..>
  If MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP is set, specifies the number of entries per
  process in the profiler's circular buffer when the profiler is first
  started.
  If unset, the platform default is used:
  %u entries per process, or %u when MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP is set.
  (8 bytes per entry -> %u or %u total bytes per process)

  MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP_DURATION=<1..>
  If MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP is set, specifies the maximum life time of
  entries in the the profiler's circular buffer when the profiler is
  first started, in seconds.
  If unset, the life time of the entries will only be restricted by
  MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP_ENTRIES (or its default value), and no
  additional time duration restriction will be applied.

  MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP_INTERVAL=<1..%d>
  If MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP is set, specifies the sample interval,
  measured in milliseconds, when the profiler is first started.
  If unset, the platform default is used.

  MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP_FEATURES_BITFIELD=<Number>
  If MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP is set, specifies the profiling features, as
  the integer value of the features bitfield.
  If unset, the value from MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP_FEATURES is used.

  MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP_FEATURES=<Features>
  If MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP is set, specifies the profiling features, as
  a comma-separated list of strings.
  Ignored if  MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP_FEATURES_BITFIELD is set.
  If unset, the platform default is used.

    Features: (x=unavailable, D/d=default/unavailable,
               S/s=MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP extra default/unavailable)
