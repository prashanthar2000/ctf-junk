cify whether SharedArrayBuffers may be serialized.
    'scope' - SameProcess, DifferentProcess, or
      DifferentProcessForIndexedDB. Determines how some values will be
      serialized. Clone buffers may only be deserialized with a compatible
      scope. NOTE - For DifferentProcess/DifferentProcessForIndexedDB,
      must also set SharedArrayBuffer:'deny' if data contains any shared memory
      object.
